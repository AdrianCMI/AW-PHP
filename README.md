# PHP Database Initialization Script

## Overview
This PHP script establishes a connection to a MySQL database, creates a new database, and then creates a table within that database. It's designed to run on a local server environment.

## Requirements
- PHP
- MySQL Server

## Configuration
Before running the script, ensure that your MySQL server is running. No additional configuration is needed if you're using the default `root` user without a password.

## Usage
1. Place the PHP file in your server's document root or a specific project directory.
2. Access the file through your web server to execute the script.
3. The script will output the status of the database and table creation processes.

## Note
This script is for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, it's crucial to use secure authentication methods and handle errors appropriately.
